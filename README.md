# Character.ai discord bot

This bot allows you to communicate with your character.ai bots inside a discord chat, making use of [node_characterai](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai).

## Features

- Easily chatting with a custom character.ai bot.
- Easy setup!
- Support via discord server.


## Getting the required data
Before the installation we need to get some tokens and IDs for the bot to function.

#### Discord bot token.
Head over to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select an application or create one. Go to the Bot tab and select create bot. After doing this discord will show you the token to your bot.

âš  This token gives access to your bot. DO NOT give it to others or post it online.

#### Character.ai chatID.
This ID will be used to connect to your character AI chat bot. 

Go to the Character.AI website, create or open a bot chat and copy the id found at the end of the URL. (https://beta.character.ai/chat?char= **chatID**)

#### Character.ai auth token.
This auth token is how you use your account via the code. (You can also use a guest account, but this will include limitations)

1. Open the [Character.AI website](https://beta.character.ai) in your browser.
2. Open the developer tools. (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or Cmd+J)
3. Go to the Application tab.
4. Go to the Storage section and click on Local Storage
5. Look for the @@auth0spajs@@:: .. 
6. Open the body with the arrows and copy the access token

#### Can't find the data?
